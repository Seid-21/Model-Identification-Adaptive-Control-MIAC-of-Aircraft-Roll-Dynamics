# Model-Identification-Adaptive-Control-MIAC-of-Aircraft-Roll-Dynamics
Designed and implemented a Model-Identification Adaptive Control (MIAC) system for aircraft roll dynamics to track reference roll rate under uncertain and varying parameters. Validated via Matlab-Simulink simulations, ensuring zero steady-state error, fast settling time, and robustness to uncertainties.
